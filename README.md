# Background

Our goal was to create an interactive dashboard that is able to predict the amount of metric tons of greenhouse gases a county will emit based on their gross domestic product (GDP). Using data from [World Resouces Institute](https://datasets.wri.org/dataset/cait-country) which had data for 187 country's GDP, population, and greenhouse gas emessions from 1990-2012. We were able to create a model based on this data and forecast what a country's potential GHG emissions are based on what an inputed GDP.
